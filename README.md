# B-Sharp/B# (Programming Language)

> Release Date: Soon
>> <red> This Programming language will not get released in public.

## Introduction
I really like my B language very much so I made a next version of B language and it's called B# (B#'s compiler is written in B, C#, C, Python, & JavaScript).  
The B# is quite similar to B but ***it's more flexible*** and ***faster performance.***

***B scripts have the file extension of .bs, .bsharp, .blacks, .blacksharp, .bsx and .ban.***  
***This programming language will support graphics.***
